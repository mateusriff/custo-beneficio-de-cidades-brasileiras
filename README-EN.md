# Cost-Benefit of Brazilian Cities

This repository contains a [Jupyter Notebook](moradia.ipynb) that analyzes and compares the residential rental price per m² for August 2025 provided by [FIPEZAP](https://www.fipe.org.br/pt-br/indices/fipezap/) with the [Social Progress Index](https://ipsbrasil.org.br/pt) of these cities measured in the same year.

## Conclusions

> "The analysis shows that some northeastern capitals have a high rental cost despite a low Social Progress Index (SPI), with Recife (PE) and Belém (PA) standing out negatively in this regard. In Barueri (SP), the rental cost per m² is the highest, but its SPI is comparable to São José do Rio Preto (SP), which has a rental cost less than half of Barueri's. Ribeirão Preto (SP), Campo Grande (MS), and Curitiba (PR) emerged as cities with the best 'cost-benefit' when equal weights are assigned to the cost per m² and SPI in the comparison."
